     We will build 5 roads to connect between all the cities = 5 * 2 = 10
     we will build 2 lib because the cities not all connected = 2 * 3 = 6
     So the total cost will be 10 + 6 = 16

     Analysis
     
     - If I have many cities lets say 3 so how can I know that I don't need to build 3 roads Just 2 roads sufficent
     If I checked when I wanted to build a road from 3 to one, check If I have access from 3 to one
     // hasAccess
     // hasAccess means that the point check from Its connected points If they contain a path to the desired one -> in this case 3 will check if 2 contains the node 1
     // How to build the roads -> Loop through the [[first,last]]
     1- if there's no vertex for one of them we create It and connect to the second one because If the node not found before so It has no any other paths
     2- If It already exist -> and we need to connect the first with the last we check if any of them contains a path to each other
     
     3- If 2 * c_lib < c_road -> Build libraries every where
