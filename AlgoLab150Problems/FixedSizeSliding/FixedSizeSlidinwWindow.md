### Fixed size sliding window, Is improving complexity in problems could need n^2 complexity. The technique is using one loop instead of 2 and every loop we move with fixed box or window. So example of that if we have array like [1,3,2,5,7,6] and we need to get the max sum of adjacent substring so Instead of making 2 loops we make one loop and every move we subtract the last element so it's like we are moving a complete block not just a number
